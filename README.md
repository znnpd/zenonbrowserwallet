Zenon Browser Wallet is intended to be the de-facto standard tool for bridging Web3 applications to the Zenon Network of Momentum. 

Until mid 2022 we focus on the following features as MVP:
* Import accounts or create new accounts
* Sign transactions from web3 websites
* Send/receive transactions
* Show balance of all coins
